This is a training project: testing of the RestAPI https://yandex.ru/dev/speller/doc/dg/concepts/api-overview-docpage/

The file speller_rest.py is the first task.
No OOP or modularity is used.
Just basics:
test runner: pytest
http client: python module 'requests'

Most test assert expected error code parsed from the json responce of the RestAPI as per:
https://yandex.ru/dev/speller/doc/dg/reference/error-codes-docpage/


The folder "YandexSpellerAPIRepresentation"
Based on the documentation to the restAPI the following classes were developed:
SpellerrestAPI.py - for forming the parameters to pass out of available param options and for executing the request using one of the RestAPI methods
SpellerresponseParser.py - the possible error codes and fields which might be needed for assertions

test_yandex_speller.py is a file with one test showing how to use developed api for testing
